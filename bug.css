The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if there are spaces between the operators and operands in the `calc()` expression, it may not work as expected in some browsers.  For example, the following code might not be rendered correctly:

```css
.element {
  width: calc( 100px + 50% );
}
```

The spaces around the `+` operator should be removed:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100px + 50%);
}
```
